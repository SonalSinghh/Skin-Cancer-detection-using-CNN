# Skin-Cancer-detection-using-CNN

Skin cancer is the most prevalent kind of cancer
. Because of skin cancerâ€™s quick growth rate, high treatment
costs, and high fatality rate, early identification has become
increasingly important. This project uses deep neural networks
and transfer learning architecture to create an artificial skin
cancer diagnosis system. We trained and tested our models using
the publicly accessible processed skin cancer images from the
ISIC Archive. The accuracy was 0.920, precision was 0.91, recall
was 0.91, F1 score was 0.91, and the ROC-AUC was 0.914
